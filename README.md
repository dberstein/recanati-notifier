Here’s a complex and engaging backend programming task that avoids the specified exclusions while challenging his problem-solving skills:

# Task: Implement a Multi-Channel Notification System with Dynamic Configuration

## Problem Statement:

You are tasked with building a multi-channel notification system that can send notifications to users via different channels (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) based on user preferences. The system should be able to handle a high volume of notifications and allow for dynamic configuration of notification channels.

## Requirements:

### User Preferences:

Design a data model that stores user preferences for notification channels. Each user should be able to opt in or out of specific channels (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications).
Allow users to specify the frequency of notifications (e.g., instant, daily digest, weekly summary).

### Notification Types:

Implement different types of notifications, such as:
- Informational: General information (e.g., updates, newsletters).
- Alerts: Critical alerts that require immediate attention (e.g., system outages).
- Reminders: Notifications that serve as reminders for events or tasks.

### Dynamic Configuration:

Implement an API endpoint to update user notification preferences dynamically.
Allow for configuration of message templates for each channel, enabling customization of notification content.

### Notification Dispatching:

Implement a dispatch system that queues and sends notifications based on user preferences and the type of notification.
Ensure that notifications are sent efficiently, with the ability to handle spikes in demand without loss of messages.

### Error Handling:

Include robust error handling for failed notification deliveries. Implement a retry mechanism for failed attempts, logging the errors for further analysis.
Ensure that users are informed if a notification fails to be sent, allowing them to update their preferences if necessary.

### API Endpoints:

- `POST /users/preferences`: Update user notification preferences (which channels to use and frequency).
- `POST /notifications`: Send a notification to users based on their preferences.
- `GET /notifications/status`: Retrieve the status of sent notifications (success, failure, retry attempts).

## Testing and Scalability:

Write unit tests to ensure the notification dispatch logic works correctly under various scenarios.
Discuss potential strategies for scaling the system to handle a growing number of users and notifications.

## Recording and Reflection:

After completing the task, ask him to document the design decisions made regarding user preferences, dispatch mechanisms, and error handling strategies.
Encourage him to reflect on the challenges faced and how they could be addressed in a production environment.

## Technical Focus:

This task involves designing a flexible and scalable notification system, which requires critical thinking about data modeling, dispatch logic, error handling, and user interaction. It’s complex enough to engage his advanced skills while remaining feasible to complete in around twenty minutes.
